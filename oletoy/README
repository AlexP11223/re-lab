Oletoy is a set of Python scripts to parse and view contents of OLE container 
based file formats by Microsoft. Originally oletoy was developed for 
reverse-engineering of Microsoft Publisher file formats.

The scripts depend on libgsf which has to be built with Python support 
(--with-python). If you are Ubuntu user, you are unlucky and have to recompile 
libgsf from source code which you can find here:
