OLE Toy is a set of Python scripts to parse and view contents of various 
binary file formats. Originally OLE Toy was developed for 
reverse-engineering of Microsoft Publisher file format, but later support 
for more of them was added, partially written from scratch, partially 
moved from our earlier work.

As of now OLE Toy reads and parses:

- PUB (Microsoft Publisher)
- VSD, VSS (Microsoft Visio)
- DOC (Microsoft Word)
- XLS (Microsoft Excel)
- PUB (Microsoft Publisher)
- PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- VBA (Microsoft Office)
- CLP (Microsoft clipboard)
- FH (Macromedia Freehand)
- CDR (Corel DRAW)
- EMF, EMF+, WMF (Microsoft)
- REX, RX2 (Propellerheads ReCycle)

The scripts depend on libgsf.
You can find libgsf source code here:

To run oletoy just do

$ ./view.py

clean-room reverse-engineering. No DLL and EXE files have been looked at.
